# Open5E API

The Open5e API is a project meant to share our organized and sorted data from the Dungeons and Dragon System Reference Document, a document used to create a framework for roleplaying Dungeons and Dragons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have working installations of Python 3.4+ and pipenv to get working on this.

### Installation

**ALL COMMANDS ASSUME YOU ARE IN THE open5e/server DIRECTORY, NOT THE ROOT OF THE REPOSITORY.**

Export the following environment variable used by the rest of the system.

> export DJANGO_SECRET='YOUR_UNIQUE_SECRET_HERE' # Unique key for DB hashing

Then, dependencies from our Pipfile.

> pipenv install

Create the empty database.

> pipenv run python manage.py migrate

Load the database with the 5e SRD data from the data folder.

> pipenv run python manage.py populatedb --flush ../data/WOTC_5e_SRD_v5.1/

Run the webserver.

> pipenv run python manage.py runserver

The server should then be up and running on http://localhost:8000.

## Built with

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.7 - Should work fine in anything above 3.4
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 2.0 - The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
- [django-rest](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - Very helpful API framework, makes the whole thing WAY smoother.
